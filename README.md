Folder Structure, Work and Build With CMake
==================================

# Folder Structure

The folders in this repository are organized so that you can use CMake
to build for your favorite platform and IDE. 

The three top-level folders:
- `apps`: Applications go here. All the "*.cpp" files.
- `include`:  Header files will go here. All the "*.h" or "*.hpp" files.
- `docs`: Documentation about the application goes here. Such as the ReadMe file.
  
# Working with `CMake`

`CMake` is a command-line utility.  However, it is aware of the common
IDEs such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Xcode, and others.  CMake is
included as part of the extensions for Visual Studio and Visual Studio
Code.  If you're working with the full version of Visual Studio,  use
the links to the PowerShell CLI installed by Visual Studio.  MacOS users
will need to use the HomeBrew package manager to install `CMake`.

## Building with CMake on Linux, MacOS, and Windows

Linux and MacOS
===============
On Linux and MacOS, you can build the project using CMake as well. Follow these steps:
   1. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
   2. Execute the following command to generate the build system for your               	platform:

	cmake -S . -B build
	
   This command looks for the CMake data files and your source code in the
   current folder (specified by -S .) and creates the build files in a folder
   named "build". You can replace "build" with any name you prefer.

   3. Once the build system is generated, navigate into the build directory:

	cd build

   4. Build your application by running:

	cmake --build .

This command will build the project using the default generator specified by CMake, which is usually Makefiles on Linux and MacOS.

Windows
=======
If you're running on Windows, `Cmake` understands the Microsoft Build
format and will create Visual Studio project files for you.  Just point
Visual Studio at that folder.  And Visual Studio (and Visual Studio Code
with Cmake extensions added) understand CMake... you only need to open
the IDE in the folder where `CmakeLists.txt` is located.

On Windows, you can use CMake to generate Visual Studio project files. Follow these steps:

   1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.
   2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in the command prompt.
   3. Execute the following command to generate the Visual Studio project files:

	cmake -S . -B build.windows

   This command looks for the CMake data files and your source code in the
   current folder (specified by -S .) and creates the build files in a folder named                            
   "build.windows". You can replace "build.windows" with any name you prefer.

   4. Once the Visual Studio project files are generated, navigate into the         	build.windows directory:

	cd build.windows

   5. Build your application by running:

	cmake --build .

This command will build the project using the Visual Studio solution file generated by CMake.

Additional Notes
================
If you prefer to use a specific generator with CMake on Windows, you can specify it by adding the -G flag followed by the generator name when running the initial cmake command. For example, to generate project files for Visual Studio 2022, you can use:

	cmake -S . -B build.windows -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"

Remember to replace occurrences of build or build.windows with your chosen build directory name if you use a different name during the generation of the build system.

Ensure that you have CMake installed on your system. You can download it from the official CMake website for Windows or install it using package managers like HomeBrew on MacOS or your Linux distribution's package manager (e.g., apt on Ubuntu).
